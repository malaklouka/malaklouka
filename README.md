### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Malak Nakaa :smile_cat: ,freshly graduated with a master degree in software engineering, having made a retraining in FullStack JS Web Developer.

On a personal level, I am highly-motivated, result oriented, self-driven, hard-working, fast learner and constantly seeking to improve my skills and am fully aware of the latest Full stack Development Tools.

In addition to this, I have the ability to adapt to any type of team environment, I am team oriented and get along with others when working in a group setting.

I also have the ability to work independently while staying on schedule and meeting those tight deadlines.

:computer: Iâ€™m currently learning new technologies.
